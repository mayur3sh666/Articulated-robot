📢After months of dedication. I am proud to share my engineering project I completed using Fusion 360 and Arduino IDE as part of my mini project.

Made 5 Degrees of freedom Articulated robot for pick and place operation


💡Components I used 
1. Servo motor Mg995 X 3 (arm translation)
2. Mini servo motors Mg90s X 2 (orientation of tool or gripper)
3. 3d printed parts
4. Arduino mega 
5. Male to male jumper wires
6. Dc jack barrel
7. Dc adapter 5v 3amp

🖥 Modelling and Programming

1⃣ I made the model in fusion 360
2⃣ 3d printed it
3⃣ Programming in Arduino IDE

🔮Future add ons

1⃣ Working using forward kinematics
2⃣ Working using inverse kinematics
3⃣ Simulation in gazebo


🌐By changing the end effector the robot can do -
✅ Lab automation in biomedical
✅ Welding
✅ Spray painting
✅ Food industry for sorting and quality control
✅ Pick and place
✅ Harvesting in agriculture
✅Loading and unloading
✅ Component assembly in aerospace
